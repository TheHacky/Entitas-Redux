# Entitas Redux

## About
Entitas Redux is a reworked version of [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp) with a sole focus on Unity. For more background on this project, see [here](BACKGROUND.md) for more information.

## Requirements
* **Min Unity Version**: 2019.4
* **Scripting Runtime**: .Net 4.X

## Installing Entitas Redux
Using this library in your project can be done in three ways:

### Install via OpenUPM
The package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com/). It's recommended to install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

```
openupm add com.jeffcampbellmakesgames.entitasredux
```

### Install via GIT URL
Using the native Unity Package Manager, you can add this library as a package by modifying your `manifest.json` file found at `/ProjectName/Packages/manifest.json` to include it as a dependency. See the example below on how to reference it.

```
{
	"dependencies": {
		...
		"com.jeffcampbellmakesgames.genesis" : "https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/genesis.git#release/stable",
		"com.jeffcampbellmakesgames.entitasredux" : "https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/entitasredux.git#releases/stable",
		...
	}
}
```


You will need to have Git installed and available in your system's PATH.

### Install via classic `.UnityPackage`
The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/entitas-redux/releases) as a UnityPackage file that can be downloaded and imported directly into your project's Assets folder.

**Note:** If you install EntitasRedux using a `.UnityPackage` you must also grab the latest release of Genesis as well from [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/Genesis) as it is not included. For better dependency handling, I would recommend using OpenUPM instead.

## Usage

Entitas Redux at the moment is largely representative of the features present in `v1.13.0` of Entitas. As a temporary solution for now, I would point you to the Entitas Wiki [here](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Tutorials) for a breakdown on features and documentation on usage. In the future, EntitasRedux documentation and code examples will be hosted on this repository's wiki [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/Entitas-Redux/wiki).

## Support
If this is useful to you and/or youâ€™d like to see future development and more tools in the future, please consider supporting it either by contributing to the Github projects (submitting bug reports or features and/or creating pull requests) or by buying me coffee using any of the links below. Every little bit helps!
